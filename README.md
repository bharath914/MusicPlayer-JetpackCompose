## 🖥️Tech Stack

**⭐Jetpack compose :**  Android latest ui library that comes from google . It is so much convenient to use JetpackCompose than the old XML files . Try it and you will never regret !

**🎵Exoplayer :**  Exoplayer have a lot of inbuilt features than the traditional media player . It will reduce our work in arranging the mediaitems , notification etc. 

**💉DaggerHilt :**  Dependency Injection is so much helpful and saves us a lot code in injecting the dependencies . Dagger Hilt is the simplest dagger library that comes from google . If you never used dagger hilt , Just use it ,It is awesome 

**📱SplashScreen :** have you ever noticed when you open an app like twitter , youtube . When you open that app they displays their logo first, the reason of using a SplashScreen is u can load or do some background work while opening the app and the user will not see any blank screen . Instead they see your logo.

**😍Material3 UI :** Material3 is the new design pattern. Used mostly in google apps . It contains predefined fontstyles, colors and supports dynamic color from Android 12

**🚀Coroutines :** Coroutines are threads but on steriods !
They are light weight , super fast 
.
In this we use coroutines for super fast and lag free search operations and displaying dynamically the list of songs . 


## ⚙️Architecture📐 
In this app we use **MVVM**  Architecture

MVVM Stands for 

M-Model

V-View

VM-ViewModel

Basically we use this architecture for mainting our code clean and organized . This architecture is highly recommend by google.
In simple words **Model** stands for the type of data 
**View** is our UI and **ViewModel** contains the business logic between ui and model and other logic we need
